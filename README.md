The purpose of the seeding app is to automate a way for the L'Orealistar team to perform client seedings.

My latest changes are on the aoife_development_branch so if you would like to work from those, you will need to checkout that branch.

A bare bones list of things relevant to basic usage that left (based on aoife_development_branch) to do are:

  - [X] Upload data for selection
	- [X] Upload data to exclude from selections
	- [ ] Download data
	- [ ] Filter by since last visit / interaction (with slider?)
	- [X] Proportion of statuses in input = proportion of statuses in input (and adjustability for this)
	- [X] Proportion control for other columns - e.g. 20% from Ireland, 80% from UK
	- [ ] Rank by points
	- [ ] Rank by tests completed
	- [ ] Remove specific locations 
	- [ ] Filter to specific values in columns e.g. only people who use a particular eyeshadow shade
	- [ ] Make all of these ui features work in tandem

Some nice to haves are: 
  - [ ] Be able to look at histogram for days since last active
  - [ ] what happens if a password protected file is uploaded?
  - [ ] Option to export full dataset of selected users and a csv with only Ids column
